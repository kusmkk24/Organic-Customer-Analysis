This project utilized machine learning techniques to identify and profile customers most likely to purchase organic products at Wake Supermarket, providing actionable insights to guide targeted marketing and inventory decisions.

Key Steps:

* Data Preparation: Cleaned data by addressing missing values, transforming categorical variables, and removing the TargetAmt column to prevent overlap with the binary target variable (TargetBuy).
* Modeling: Tested and tuned Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models. The tuned Gradient Boosting Classifier was chosen for its high accuracy and balanced metrics.
* Clustering Analysis: Applied k-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behaviors, uncovering additional patterns in organic buying trends.
* Insights: Younger, female customers with moderate affluence, lower annual spending, and Tin memberships were identified as the primary buyers of organic products.
* Recommendations: Developed strategies including localized marketing, loyalty program enhancements, and competitive pricing to engage this customer segment effectively.

This project showcases the application of clustering, predictive modeling, and actionable insights to solve a real-world business problem.
